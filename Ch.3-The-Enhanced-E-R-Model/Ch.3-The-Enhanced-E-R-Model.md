# Ch.3 The Enhanced E-R Model-   The most important modeling construct incorporated in the EER model is supertype/subtype relationships. This facility enables you to model a general entity type (called the supertype) and then subdivide it into several specialized entity types (called subtypes).

-   [Entity clustering]{.underline} is a way to turn a part of an E-R data model into a more macro-level view of the same data. Entity clustering is a hierarchical decomposition technique (a nesting process of breaking a system into further and further subparts), which can make E-R diagrams easier to read and databases easier to design.
