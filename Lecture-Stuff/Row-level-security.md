# Row level securityWhat is row level security?

-   We see row level security everywhere, for example on canvas we don't get to see everyones grades, only our grades. Why? Because somewhere (ideaslly set in the database) we have row level security which only allows us to retrieve data from the tables that we are given access to that correspond to us (say a studentID)

-   This is important because we don't want everyone to just be able to see everyone elses shit
