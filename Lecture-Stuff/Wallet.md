# Wallet-   The full way of logging into a database is by opening a command prompt and typing in...

> SQLPLUS [USER]/[PSW]@[HOST]:[PORT]/[SERVICE NAME]
>
> SQLPLUS PROD3/PROD3@12.334.1334.32:1554/SPRING2024PDB

-   Instead of doing all of that we could do

> SQLPLUS [USER]/[PSW]@[SERVICENAME]
>
> SQLPLUS PROD3/PROD3@SPRING2024PDB

-   But you must have the tsa admin pointing to the tnsnames file which has all the information for connecting to the database

-   When you use the SERVICENAME it knows to go into the tnsnames file and retrieve the tns alias's data without the host, port, or servicename

<!-- -->

-   The tnsnames files is a file which describes the database connections

-   If you ever decide to change the database from one server to another all you have to do is publish a new tnsnames file

-   The only bad thing about this method so far is that the password and user name is still needed which can be a security problem

Â 

We want a way to store passwords in an encrypted file, the password for the [USER] who is authenticated to the database

-   In this way we don't have to give the password and username away

-   We can do this with a wallet

    -   We first use the "mkstore -wrl C:Oracle21cnetworkadmin -create" command

        -   Mkstore -wrl [location of oracle and in what directory you want to store it in inside of oracle file] -create

    -   We then get asked to set a password in which case we do

    -   We then get 4 new files

        -   Ewallet.p12.lck

        -   Ewallet

        -   Cwallet.sso.lck

        -   Cwallet.sso

    -   These 4 files are the wallet

    -   Currently there is nothing in the wallet, we havent added any credentials yet

    -   We will now add a USER to the wallet

        -   We use the command "mkstore -wrl C:Oracle21cnetworkadmin -createCredential SPRING2024PDB PROD3 PROD3"

            -   Where the last three arguments are TNSENTRY(service name) USER PSW

            -   What this command will do is add that credential to the wallet

        -   It will then ask you for the wallet password which was set upon creating the wallet

    -   Now we have a wallet, an encrypted file, that has the credentials for a USER, lets say PROD3, sitting in that wallet

    -   Now we can connect to the database using the wallet

        -   Sqlplus /@spring2024pdb

        -   Now we are connected as PROD3

    -   The only limitation with this is that you can only have one user associated with a connection

        -   For example if you have 17 users, who want to wallet in you need 17 different connections in the tsnnames which sucks

    -   One way around that is instead of running the command...

> "mkstore -wrl C:Oracle21cnetworkadmin -createCredential SPRING2024PDB PROD3 PROD3"
>
> We do...
>
> "mkstore -wrl C:Oracle21cnetworkadmin -createCredential SPRING2024PDB SSO_USER SSO_USER"

-   What happens now is that SSO_USER is now the user and psw

-   If we do sqlplus /@spring2024pdb we are now connecteed as SSO_USER

<!-- -->

-   So far we only have one user in the wallet called SSO_USER which doesn't help much

    -   Remember We don't have PROD3 cause we essentially restarted, so forget about PROD3

-   If we run the sql code ALTER USER [USERNAME] GRANT CONNECT THROGH SSO_USER we will see that we can do

    -   Lets say we granted UD_JASONC connect through sso_user

    -   We can in the command line do..

    -   [UD_JASONC]/@SPRING2024PDB

-   What this will do is grant us connection to the database as UD_JASONC

-   What this does is the admin can allow you to grant through SSO_USER but you must have the wallet on your computer (personal computer)

-   How does it work:

    -   In sqlnet, I have an entry/text called WALLET_LOCATION which says that the wallet location is sitting user TNS_ADMIN and %TNS_ADMIN% is pointing to that directory

    -   When we try to wallet in it will open up %TNS_ADMIN% and it will look for that credential based on the input/connection you are trying to make, then retrieve the user and password and log you in that way

<!-- -->

-   HOW does it work in the big picture?

    -   We do what is called single sign on user

    -   We grant proxy permission to that sign on

    -   We add that sign on user to the wallet

    -   We install it on the application server that needs the wallet

        -   Essentially we will be allowing say an employee to be able to sign in using SSO_USER and their username say UD_VICVAS (you would use square brackets like [UD_VICVAS] to denote proxy)

        -   We do this proxy thing because a wallet only allows us to authenticate one user and by having that user be SSO_USER and then using it to get into our "account" with it allows us to take advantage of the features of using a wallet but also we don't have to create thousands of wallets for each user

    -   We change the web configurations needed to be able to authenticate/log on

    -   On the top level of the database we have a table called something like proxy_logon and some triggers

        -   This will help make it so not everyone can just proxy in only authenticated computers, servers, etc.

        -   We will have a sort of whitelist
